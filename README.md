## Introduction

This project provides a Python implementation of a simplified blockchain network. It demonstrates the concepts of blockchain, proof-of-work consensus, and basic transaction management. The code consists of two classes, `Block` and `Blockchain`, that work together to create a secure and tamper-proof chain of blocks.

## Features

- **Decentralized Blockchain:** The simulation showcases a decentralized network of blocks, with each block containing data, a timestamp, and a hash of the previous block.
- **Proof-of-Work Consensus:** The blockchain utilizes a proof-of-work algorithm to ensure the integrity of the chain and to validate new blocks before they are added.
- **Transaction Functionality:** The simulation includes basic transaction functionality where each block can hold transaction data.

## Getting Started

To run the blockchain simulation on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local system.
2. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the cloned directory.

## Usage

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.
2. Run the following command to execute the blockchain simulation:

    ```bash
python blockchain.py

3. The simulation will mine blocks and display the results, including the mined blocks' hashes and the validity of the blockchain.

## Advanced Usage

If you're familiar with blockchain concepts and Python, you can explore and modify the code for more advanced use cases:

- Adjust the `difficulty` value in the `Blockchain` class to control the proof-of-work difficulty.
- Modify the data structure in the `Block` class to accommodate additional transaction details.
- Experiment with different hashing algorithms or consensus mechanisms.
